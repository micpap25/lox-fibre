# lox-fibre
 My implementation of the jlox and clox languages from the "crafting langauges" online book. The "fibre" name comes from a prospective language I would like to build. The only differences I intend to have are shortened keywords, as I intend "fibre" to one day fucntion as a code-golf oriented language with various shortcuts. I think this is a pretty good place to start, right?
